Rear View is a review-sharing website developed using the MERN stack. Here, users can sign up, login and create reviews for their favorite shows, movies, anime, etc. The
reviews they post is available for all to see on the homepage. Users can add a title, image and custom tags to each of their reviews. They can also like the reviews posted
by other users (and even themselves, though such practice goes against conventional social media norms). Users can also delete their own posts if they want.
